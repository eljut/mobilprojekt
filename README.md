# MirrorRoom - A "Follow the leader" mobile game

This game is built using [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/ "Apache Cordova's website"), [Pubnub](https://www.pubnub.com/ "Pubnub's website"), [Device Orientation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceOrientationEvent "Mozilla about DeviceOrientationEvent") and [Geolocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolocation "Wikipedia about Geolocation").
Played by having the leader orienting their phone in a certain way and moving a distance(optional), and then the other participants should replicate the orientation and movement.
